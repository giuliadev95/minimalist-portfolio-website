  Hey, Iâ€™m Alex Spencer and I love building beautiful websites

  About Me

  About Me

  Iâ€™m a junior front-end developer looking for a new role in an exciting company. 
  I focus on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices and writing clean 
  JavaScript. When writing JavaScript code, I mostly use React, but I can adapt to 
  whatever tools are required. Iâ€™m based in London, UK, but Iâ€™m happy working remotely 
  and have experience in remote teams. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me outdoors. 
  I love being out in nature whether thatâ€™s going for a walk, run or cycling. Iâ€™d love 
  you to check out my work.
